# Prosody in Print: Classifying Written Text by Rhythm and Sound
Junior Independent Work for Fall 2017, Department of Computer Science

## Abstract:
The notion of "style" is an important one as it relates to what makes certain types of written text appear to be different from other ones. While previous studies into the linguistic qualities that contribute to style have primarily examined lexical and text-based features, we propose that phonological features relating to the organization of sound in language are also a significant aspect of stylistic differences between texts. This paper looks specifically at prosodic rhythm, examining two measurements: the regularity of stressed beats (microrhythm) and the regularity of high/low pitch movements (macrorhythm). We hypothesize that when comparing creative and noncreative writings, the former is not only more rhythmic overall than the latter, but also has a higher degree of rhythmic variation. To evaluate how impactful these features are in differentiating texts, we use them to develop a classification model applied to three categories of text where stylistic differences seem most salient: poetry, prose, and research publications.
