It was love at first sight.
The first time Yo sari an saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.
Yo sari an was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.
The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice.
If it became jaundice they could treat it.
If it didn't become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.
But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.
Each morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths and inefficient eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duck it, one of the ward nurses who didn't like Yo sari an.
They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain.
They seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.
Still no movement? the full colonel demanded.
The doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.
Give him another pill.
Nurse Duck it made a note to give Yo sari an another pill, and the four of them moved along to the next bed.
None of the nurses liked Yo sari an.
Actually, the pain in his liver had gone away, but Yossarian didn't say anything and the doctors never suspected.
They just suspected that he had been moving his bowels and not telling anyone.
Yossarian had everything he wanted in the hospital.
The food wasn't too bad, and his meals were brought to him in bed.
There were extra rations of fresh meat, and during the hot part of the afternoon he and the others were served chilled fruit juice or chilled chocolate milk.
