Your girl catches you cheating.
Well, actually she’s your fiancee, but hey, in a bit it so won’t matter.
She could have caught you with one su sia, she could have caught you with two, but because you’re a totally batshit coo era who never empties his e mail trash can, she caught you with fifty!
Sure, over a six-year period, but still.
Fifty fucking girls?
God damn!
Maybe if you’d been engaged to a super-open-minded blanc key ta you could have survived it — but you’re not engaged to a super-open-minded blanc key ta.
Your girl is a bad-ass sal se dense who doesn’t believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating.
I’ll put a machete in you, she promised.
And, of course, you swore you wouldn’t do it.
You swore you wouldn’t.
You swore you wouldn’t.
And you did.
She’ll stick around for a few months because you been together a long, long time.
Because you’ve gone through so much together — her father’s death, your tenure madness, her bar exam (passed on the third attempt).
And because love, real love, is not so easily shed.
Over a tortured six-month period you fly together to the D R, to Mexico (for the funeral of a friend), to New Zealand.
You walk the beach where they filmed The Piano, something she’s always wanted to do, and now, in penitent desperation, you give it to her.
She is immensely sad on that beach and she walks up and down the shining sand alone, her bare feet in the freezing water, and when you try to hug her she says, Don’t.
She stares at the rocks jutting out of the water, the wind carrying her hair straight back.
