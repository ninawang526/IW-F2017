A small upper bedroom in the home of Reverend Samuel Paris, Salem, Massachusetts, in the spring of the year sixteen ninety two.
There is a narrow window at the left. Through its leaded panes the morning sunlight streams.
A candle still burns near the bed, which is at the right.
A chest, a chair, and a small table are the other furnishings.
At the back a door opens on the landing of the stairway to the ground floor.
The room gives of an air of clean spareness.
The roof rafters are exposed, and the wood colors are raw and un mellow.
As the curtain rises, Reverend Paris is discovered kneeling beside the bed, evidently in prayer.
His daughter, Betty Paris, aged ten, is lying on the bed, inert.
At the time of these events Paris was in his middle forties.
In history he cut a villainous path, and there is very little good to be said for him.
He believed he was being persecuted wherever he went, despite his best efforts to win people and God to his side.
In meeting, he felt insulted if someone rose to shut the door without first asking his permission.
He was a widower with no interest in children, or talent with them.
He regarded them as young adults, and until this strange crisis he, like the rest of Salem, never conceived that the children were anything but thankful for being permitted to walk straight, eyes slightly lowered, arms at the sides, and mouths shut until bidden to speak.
His house stood in the town — but we today would hardly call it a village.
The meeting house was nearby, and from this point outward—toward the bay or inland—there were a few small windowed, dark houses snuggling against the raw Massachusetts winter.
Salem had been established hardly forty years before.
To the European world the whole province was a barbaric frontier inhabited by a sect of fanatics who, nevertheless, were shipping out products of slowly increasing quantity and value.
No one can really know what their lives were like.
