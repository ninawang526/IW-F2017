This then is my story.
I have reread it.
It has bits of marrow sticking to it, and blood, and beautiful bright-green flies.
At this or that twist of it I feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters than I care to probe.
I have camouflaged what I could so as not to hurt people.
And I have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before I hit on a particularly apt one.
There are in my notes Otto Otto and Mesmer Mesmer and Lambert Lambert, but for some reason I think my choice expresses the nastiness best.
When I started, fifty-six days ago, to write Lolita, first in the psycho pathic ward for observation, and then in this well-heated, albeit tombal, seclusion, I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul.
In mind composition, however, I realized that I could not parade living Lolita.
I still may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred.
For reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, I am opposed to capital punishment; this attitude will be, I trust, shared by the sentencing judge.
Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges.
But even so, Dolly Schiller will probably survive me by many years. 
The following decision I make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament: I wish this memoir to be published only when Lolita is no longer alive.
Thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book.
But while the blood still throbs through my writing hand, you are still as much part of blessed matter as I am, and I can still talk to you from here to Alaska.
Be true to your Dick.
Do not let other fellows touch you.
Do not talk to strangers.
I hope you will love your baby.
