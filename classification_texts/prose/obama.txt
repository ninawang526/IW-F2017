I remember sitting down with Bill in Paris a couple years ago, where the world was coming together to hammer out an agreement — a small agreement to save the planet — by taking meaningful action to tackle climate change.
It’s a threat that may define the contours of this century more than just about anything else.
Here was the interesting thing, Bill saw this not simply as a challenge, but as an opportunity.
I remember him in sort of a matter of fact way saying, Well, we’re going to just have to go ahead and invent some new technologies.
Which I said, I agree, let’s do that, although he knows more than me about inventing new technologies.
But his tone was, Yes, this is hard, but we can figure it out.
It’s hard but, it can be done.
And that spirit, the spirit that says, to quote I guess myself, Yes we can, rather than despair, is the motor by which we’ve been able to see real progress in reducing the pace of carbon emissions increases here in the U S.
And even if at the current moment the federal government is not as engaged in these efforts as I would like, nevertheless progress continues because of the efforts of people like Bill, and a whole host of entrepreneurs, and universities, and cities, and states.
They are making change around energy policy in America separate and apart from what government is doing and that gives confidence that we can continue to make progress.
My broader point here is that, you tend to believe when Bill says that we can do something, that we can do it.
And when all of you stand up and say this is something we can do, that kind spirit is infectious.
And it’s exactly what we need right now.
We do face extraordinary challenges.
You’ve heard of many of them in your discussions today.
You know the nature of these challenges from your work.
Growing economic inequality.
Still too much extreme poverty.
Still too many girls who are denied an education.
The rise of nationalism and xenophobia.
