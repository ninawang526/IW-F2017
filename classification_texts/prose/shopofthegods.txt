Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins the conversation as if we were already in the middle of an argument.
Pearl ah, have to go, no choice, my mother said when she phoned last week.
After several minutes I learned the reason for her call: Auntie Helen was inviting the whole family to my cousin Bao-bao engagement party.
The whole family means the wong and the Louise. The wong are Auntie Helen, Uncle Henry, Mary, Frank, and Bao-bao.
And these days the Louise really refers only to my mother and me, since my father is dead and my brother, Samuel, lives in New Jersey.
We've been known as the whole family for as long as I can remember, even though the wong aren't related to us by blood, just by marriage; Auntie Helen's first husband was my mother's brother, who died long before I was born.
And then there's my cousin Bao-bao, whose real name is Roger. 
Everyone in the family has been calling him Bao-bao ever since he was a baby, which is what bao-bao means, precious baby.
Later, we kept calling him that because he was the cry baby who always wailed the minute my aunt and uncle walked in the door, claiming we other kids had been picking on him.
And even though he's now thirty-one years old, we still think of him as Bao-bao-and we're still picking on him.
Bao-bao?
How can he have an engagement party? I said.
This will be his third marriage.
Fourth engagement! my mother said. 
Last one he didn't marry, broken off after we already sent a gift.
Of course, Helen is not calling it engagement party.
She is saying this is a big reunion for Mary.
Mary is coming? I asked. 
Mary and I have a history that goes beyond being cousins.
She's married to Doug Chou, who went to medical school with my husband, Phil Brand, and in fact, she was the one who introduced us to each other sixteen years ago.
