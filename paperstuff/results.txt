"This sentence has five words! Here are five more words? Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what's happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record."

"In this paper, the problem of pedestrian egress under different geometries is studied by means of two numerical models. The length of the bottleneck after the exit and the distance of the exit to the lateral wall of a squared room are investigated. Both models show that an increase in the bottleneck length increases the evacuation time by more than 20 %, for any exit position. Hence, a bottleneck length tending to zero is the best choice. On the contrary, the results of moving the exit closer to the lateral wall are different in both models and, thus, its convenience cannot be stated. To unveil whether this layout modification is favorable, experimental data are required. Moreover, the discrepancy between models indicates that they should be validated considering several scenarios."

Although systems near equilibrium are often amenable to a relatively simple quantitative description, for large deviations from equilibrium a proper understanding of the physics involved can be a difficult, but exciting and stimulating process. Small variations in the characteristic parameters may lead to drastic changes in the system behavior, sometimes leading to formidable challenges for the interested researchers. Since systems far from equilibrium are ubiquitous in nature, the techniques developed to solve problems in one particular discipline often find application across many branches of the scientific endeavor.

"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course un trimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou oust;
Nor shall death brag thou wanders in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grows:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

One twenty four was spiteful. Full of a baby's venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put up with the spite in his own way, but by eighteen seventy three Seth and her daughter Denver were its only victims. The grandmother, Baby Suggs, was dead, and the sons, Howard and Bug lar, had run away by the time they were thirteen years old- as soon as merely looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for Bug lar); as soon as two tiny hand prints appeared in the cake (that was it for Howard). Neither boy waited to see more; another kettle full of chick peas smoking in a heap on the floor; soda crackers crumbled and strewn in a line next to the door sill. Nor did they wait for one of the relief periods: the weeks, months even, when nothing was disturbed. No. Each one fled at once- the moment the house committed what was for him the one insult not to be borne or witnessed a second time. Within two months, in the dead of winter, leaving their grandmother, Baby Suggs; Seth, their mother; and their little sister, Denver, all by themselves in the gray and white house on Bluestone Road. It didn't have a number then, because Cincinnati didn't stretch that far. In fact, Ohio had been calling itself a state only seventy years when first one brother and then the next stuffed quilt packing into his hat, snatched up his shoes, and crept away from the lively spite the house felt for them.
