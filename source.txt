Circadian rhythms, oscillations with approximately 24 hour period in many biological processes, are found in nearly all living organisms. Until the mid eighteen nineties, it was thought that only eukaryotic organisms had a circadian clock, since it was assumed that an endo genous clock with a period of tau equals 24 h would not be useful to organisms that often divide more rapidly.
