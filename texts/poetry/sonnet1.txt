From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauties rose might never die,
But as the ripe er should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feeds thy light's flame with self substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud bury est thy content,
And tender churl makes waste in niggard ing:
Pity the world, or else this glut ton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
