Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
A non permit the base est clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
But out! a lack! he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
Yet him for this my love no whit disdain est;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun stain est.
