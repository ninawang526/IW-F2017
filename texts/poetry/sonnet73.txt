That time of year thou mays in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou sees the twilight of such day
As after sunset fade est in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou sees the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed where on it must expire,
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
This thou perceive est, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
