Music to hear, why hears thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Why love est thou that which thou receive est not gladly,
Or else receive est with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In single ness the parts that thou should bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
Sings this to thee: Thou single wilt prove none.
