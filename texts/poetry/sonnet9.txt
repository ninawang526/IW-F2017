Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
That thou consume est thy self in single life?
Ah! if thou issue less shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a make less wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
When every private widow well may keep
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
Look! what an un thrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
But beauties waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it.
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murderous shame commits.
