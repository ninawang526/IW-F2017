Don’t you have sense enough to hold your head out the bed?
Now, look what you did.
You think I got time for nothing but washing up your puke?
The puke waddles down the pillow onto the sheet— green-gray, with flecks of orange.
It moves like the insides of an un cooked egg.
Stubbornly clinging to its own mass, refusing to break up and be removed.
How, I wonder, can it be so neat and nasty at the same time?
My mother’s voice drones on.
She is not talking to me.
She is talking to the puke, but she is calling it my name: Claudia.
She wipes it up as best she can and puts a scratchy towel over the large wet place.
I lie down again.
The rags have fallen from the window crack, and the air is cold.
I dare not call her back and am reluctant to leave my warmth.
My mother’s anger humiliates me; her words chafe my cheeks, and I am crying.
I do not know that she is not angry at me, but at my sickness.
I believe she despises my weakness for letting the sickness “take halt.” By and by I will not get sick; I will refuse to.
But for now I am crying.
I know I am making more snot, but I can’t stop.
My sister comes in.
