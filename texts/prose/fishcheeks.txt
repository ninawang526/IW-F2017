I fell in love with the minister’s son the winter I turned fourteen.
He was not Chinese, but as white as Mary in the manger.
For Christmas I prayed for this blond-haired boy, Robert, and a slim new American nose.
When I found out that my parents had invited the minister’s family over for Christmas Eve dinner, I cried.
What would Robert think of our shabby Chinese Christmas?
What would he think of our noisy Chinese relatives who lacked proper American manners?
What terrible disappointment would he feel upon seeing not a roasted turkey and sweet potatoes but Chinese food?
On Christmas Eve I saw that my mother had outdone herself in creating a strange menu.
She was pulling black veins out of the backs of fleshy prawns.
The kitchen was littered with appalling mounds of raw food: A slimy rock cod with bulging fish eyes that pleaded not to be thrown into a pan of hot oil.
Tofu, which looked like stacked wedges of rubbery white sponges. A howl soaking dried fungus back to life.
A plate of squid, their backs crisscrossed with knife markings so they resembled bicycle tires.
And then they arrived -- the minister’s family and all my relatives in a clamor of door bells and crumpled Christmas packages.
Robert grunted hello, and I pretended he was not worthy of existence.
Dinner threw me deeper into despair.
My relatives licked the ends of their chopsticks and reached across the table, dipping them into the dozen or so plates of food.
Robert and their family waited patiently for platters to be passed to them.
My relatives murmured with pleasure when my mother brought out the whole steamed fish.
Robert grimaced.
Then my father poked his chopsticks just below the fish eye and plucked out the soft meat.
